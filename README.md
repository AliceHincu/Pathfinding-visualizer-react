# Pathfinding Visualizer: About the Project
An interactive web application that helps users visualize search algorithms in a grid environment. Creted with **React** and used **typescript, redux and hooks**

Here you can find the [LIVE DEMO](https://alicehincu.github.io/Pathfinding-visualizer-react/) if you want to experiment for youself

# Motivation: Why Web Application and Why Visualize Algorithms?
* This project is an outlet for me to apply the web development knowledge I have learned during my current internship, and more importantly to gain experience in using the React and its libaries.
* I have a personal interest in learning and understanding how different algorithms work since highschool, since they tend to help resolving real world problems with an efficient time complexity if used correctly.

# Aim
To provide a platform that:
* runs and visualize search algorithms,
* highlights the differences between the search algorithms, and
* make learning about search algorithms more engaging through interactive elements.
